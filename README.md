# Remote-Sensing-Image-Classification

For this project, the dataset considered was 'Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification 45' data which was taken from the GitHub page of Gong Cheng, a professor at Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, who published a research paper ‘Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification: Benchmark and State of the Art’ by using this dataset.
This dataset also termed as 'NWPU-RESISC45' dataset is a publicly available benchmark for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. But for this project, the eight classes considered for CNN classification are ‘airplane’, ‘cloud’, ‘dense-residential’, ‘desert’, ‘forest’, ‘island’, ‘rectangular-farmland’, ‘snowberg’. These class images represent the satellite image of the scenes mentioned above. The size of each class is 700 and the total size of the full dataset utilized for this activity is 5600 images. Here, each image represents a case.
The format of all the images for all the classes is ‘RGB’ color image. The original size of all the images is 256x256 pixels.
